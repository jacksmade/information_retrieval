Advanced hashing techniques enhance efficiency: Cryptographic Hash Functions: Used for security applications, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. Perfect Hashing: A method that eliminates collisions entirely, often used in static datasets. Dynamic Hashing: Adjusts the hash table size dynamically to maintain performance as data grows. Additionally, performance considerations include load factors and resizing strategies.
