A hash table is an efficient data structure that implements an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. The keys are transformed into hash codes using a hash function. The primary operations include: Insertion: Adding a new key-value pair. Deletion: Removing a key-value pair. Search: Retrieving a value by its key. Collision resolution techniques include chaining and open addressing.
