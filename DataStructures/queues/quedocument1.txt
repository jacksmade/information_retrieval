A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. Basic operations include: Enqueue: Adding an element to the end of the queue. Dequeue: Removing the front element from the queue. Front: Viewing the front element without removing it. Queues are commonly used in scenarios like scheduling tasks, handling requests in servers, and implementing breadth-first search.
