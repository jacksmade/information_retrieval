Queues can be implemented in two primary ways: Array Implementation: Uses a fixed size, which may lead to inefficiencies if the queue is not fully utilized. Linked List Implementation: Offers dynamic sizing but may require additional memory for pointers. Variants of queues include: Circular Queue: Connects the end of the queue back to the front. Priority Queue: Elements are dequeued based on priority rather than the order they were enqueued.
