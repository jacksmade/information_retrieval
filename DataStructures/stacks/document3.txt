Stacks are essential in various algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS): Utilizes stacks for graph traversal. Backtracking Algorithms: Such as solving the N-Queens problem or maze-solving. Evaluating Expressions: Infix, Prefix, and Postfix notations can be evaluated using stacks. Additionally, stacks help in error management, like syntax checking for expressions or balancing parentheses.
