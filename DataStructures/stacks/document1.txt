A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. Basic operations include: Push: Adding an element to the top of the stack. Pop: Removing the top element from the stack. Peek/Top: Viewing the top element without removing it. Stacks are widely used in programming, particularly for function call management, undo mechanisms in applications, and expression evaluation.
