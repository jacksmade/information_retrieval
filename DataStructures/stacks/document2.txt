There are two common implementations of stacks: Array Implementation: Utilizes a fixed size, which can lead to memory wastage if not fully utilized. Resizing can be costly. Linked List Implementation: Offers dynamic sizing, allowing the stack to grow or shrink as needed. Variants of stacks include: Dynamic Stack: A stack that adjusts its size automatically. Min Stack: A specialized stack that tracks the minimum element. Double-Ended Stack (Deque): Allows insertion and removal from both ends.
